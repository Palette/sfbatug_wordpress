<?php _e('There are two workarounds available. You can set the order of application on an individual question. This option is available when creating or editing a question. If you do not want to use this option, then you can continue to use the drag and drop feature but you must raise the pagination setting. This feature can be founding by clicking on the Screen Toggle tab. You should set the pagination to a value that is higher than the amount of questions that are available and then click on the Apply button. For example, if you have a total of 15 questions, then you would want to set the pagination to a value that is higher than 15 such as 20. This will ensure that your pagination does not affect your order of questions.', 'event_espresso'); ?>
